# nonepad_editor_view

This code was extracted from the [nonepad](https://github.com/pepone42/nonepad) editor as an experiment to see how
it would be to get a simple syntax highlighted editor view for [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid).

It is early days yet, but it looks promising so far.

To try it out:

```cargo
cargo run --example simple
```
